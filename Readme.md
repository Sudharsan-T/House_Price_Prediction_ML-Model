# 🏡 Housing Price Prediction using Machine Learning
**🏠📈 Built a model to analyze housing data and predict prices with 64% accuracy (still training my ML skills—don't trust me with your dream home yet! 😆).**

### 🚀 Project Overview
This project explores housing price prediction using regression techniques. It involves:

✅ Data preprocessing & feature engineering 🛠️

✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 📊

✅ Model training with Scikit-learn 🤖

✅ Performance evaluation 📉

### ⚠️ Fun Disclaimer

"This model predicts with 64% accuracy—so it's slightly better than guessing but way worse than your gut feeling! Use at your own risk!" 😆
