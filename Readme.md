🏡 Housing Price Prediction using Machine Learning
Predicting house prices using Machine Learning! 🏠📈 Built a model to analyze housing data and predict prices with 64% accuracy (still training my ML skills—don't trust me with your dream home yet! 😆).

🚀 Project Overview
This project explores housing price prediction using regression techniques. It involves:
✅ Data preprocessing & feature engineering 🛠️
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 📊
✅ Model training with Scikit-learn 🤖
✅ Performance evaluation 📉

⚠️ Fun Disclaimer
"This model predicts with 64% accuracy—so it's slightly better than guessing but way worse than your gut feeling! Use at your own risk!" 😆
